-> the nCS is in the correct version bevore the communication is started high 
	in the wrong version it gets high shortly bevore the communication starts before it is low 

-> in the wrong transmission 16 clocks are submitted ad once in the correct work the data is transmitted 
	in two times 8 clocks 
	
-> the received MISO values for the second command appear to dont match the zynq receives a other value 		than the right system (might be caused by problem 2)

-> the second command has 3 transmission pakages not 2 in the end another command with 0x0000 is 			transmitted
